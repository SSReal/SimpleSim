# SimpleSim
A simplified discrete event simulation framework written in Python By Sajal Singhal ([SSReal](github.com/SSReal))

> This project was created taking inspiration from [Simpy](https://pypi.org/project/simpy/), which is a discrete event simulation framework written for python.

> I wanted to create a simpler interface, just for my needs, hence this module


## Features
### 1. Environment
A complete discrete simulation environment with event-by-event processing
### 2. Process
Processes that can create various different events
### 3. Resource
Resources that can be granted to, waited for, or released by processes

I have also included a test script which is a short airport simulation.
